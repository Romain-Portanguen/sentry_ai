## ‚ö†Ô∏è macOS Security Note

Sentry AI is an open-source application not signed by Apple. macOS will display a warning on first launch. This is normal and you can safely bypass this warning because:

- The source code is fully public and verifiable
- The application doesn't require privileged system access
- All dependencies are open-source and verified

To launch the application:

1. When you first try to open the app, you'll see a warning
2. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
3. Scroll down to the Security section
4. You should see a message about "Sentry AI" being blocked
5. Click "Open Anyway"
6. In the confirmation dialog, click "Open"

This procedure is only necessary on first launch.

### Why this warning appears?

This warning appears because the application is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. We keep the application unsigned to:

- Maintain complete transparency
- Keep the project fully open-source
- Avoid additional costs that would be passed to users

The application is completely safe to use, and you can verify this by:

- Reviewing our [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/Romain-Portanguen/sentry_ai)
- Building the application yourself from source
- Scanning the application with your antivirus software
